Case 5: P's parent is red, but U's uncle is black, the current node N is the
 left child of P and P is the left child of G. In this case, the tree is rotated 
by G. The result is a tree in which the former parent of P is now the parent and
 the current node N and the former grandfather G. It is known that G is black, 
since its former descendant P could not otherwise be red (without violating Proper
ty 4). Then the colors of P and G change and as a result the tree satisfies Proper
ty 4 (Both children of any red node are black). Property 5 (All paths from any giv
en node to leaf nodes contain the same number of black nodes) also remains true,
 since all paths that go through any of these three nodes previously went through
 G, so now they all go through P. B in each case, of these three nodes, only one 
is colored black.
